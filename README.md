## Real Match Autonomous Section

![match](https://github.com/ArdaBakici/FRC/blob/main/match.gif)

The robot starts the autonomous section by searching for the target. The robot is placed directly looking at the enemy alliance station and turns around itself until it sees the target.
The robot records its angle of rotation using a gyro. Since the position of the target is known, the robot uses trigonometry and the angle of rotation to find its position on the field.
Then while shooting the balls into the target it creates a trajectory from its position to the balls and then the target using Hermite splines. 
It follows this trajectory, lowers its intake and elevates it in certain coordinates, and finally shoots the balls to the target.
